## Dice roller

This is a basic dice roller. It can roll multiple dice at once and return the current and historical score.

The "user" said they wanted "to be able to roll any number of dice at the same time". That sounded like multiple Dice rather than rerolling the same one. So I made a DiceSet to store them for rolling together. This would also make it easy to roll different types of dice later on, if I added that functionality.
